PPUDD -- planning algorithm.
============================

Nicolas Drougard (nicolas.drougard@onera.fr)

## Synopsis

This project provides the code of the solver of \pi-POMDPs PPUDD 
described in "Structured Possibilistic Planning Using Decision Diagrams", 
Nicolas Drougard, Florent Teichteil-KÃ¶nigsbuch, Jean-Loup Farges, Didier Dubois.

It provides also the experiment proposed in
"Qualitative Possibilistic Mixed-Observable MDPs" of the same authors,
and the simulations of the International Probabilistic Planning Competition (IPPC) 2014.

This is presented in the context of the RDDLSim project, 
and using a library (for ADDs in C++) from the prism project.

## Example

First terminal
```
  ./run rddl.competition.Server rddl/
```

Second terminal
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/the/directory/rddlsim/prism-4.0.3-src/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
java -Xmx3g -Djava.library.path=/path/to/the/directory/rddlsim/prism-4.0.3-src/lib/ -cp '/path/to/the/directory/rddlsim/bin:/path/to/the/directory/rddlsim/lib/*' rddl.competition.Client /path/to/the/directory/rddlsim/input localhost ppudd rddl.policy.POPPUDD2policy 2323 42 RTGT_inst_pomdp.sperseus
```

## Installation

### INSTALL rddlsim:
- open this java project with eclipse;

- build path configuration: 
	right click on the project -> "Build path" -> "Configure Build Path..." -> "Libraries" tab
	-> "Add External JARs" -> Select all .jar files which are in rddlsim/lib;

- if needed (for some "import"s in solvers java files): 
	right click on the project -> "Build path" -> "Configure Build Path..." -> "Libraries" tab
	-> "JRE System Library" -> "Access rules" -> "Add..."
	- Resolution: "Accessible" 
	- Rule Pattern: "com/sun/org/**".

### INSTALL the CUDD library from the PRISM project (for ADDs):
```
cd rddlsim/prism-4.0.3-src
nano Makefile
```
- set the java directory, for instance, for me : JAVA_DIR = /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64;
- and then:
```
make
```

- In Eclipse: go to the jdd directory in /src;
	right click on JDDTest.java -> Run as -> Run Configurations... -> Environment tab -> New... 
	- Name: LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
	- Value: /path/to/the/directory/prism-4.0.3-src/lib/

and then run JDDTest.
